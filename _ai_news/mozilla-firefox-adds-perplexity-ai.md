Following a successful pilot program in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, the feature is now being rolled out globally to desktop users based on positive feedback, with a mobile version planned for the coming months.

## A new search experience

Unlike traditional search engines that provide a list of links, Perplexity offers a conversational search experience, delivering summarized answers with citations. Users can access it via the unified search button in Firefox's address bar or set it as their default search provider in the browser's settings. 

## Privacy commitment

Mozilla highlighted that Perplexity maintains user privacy by not sharing or selling personal data.

## Additional Firefox features

Alongside the AI search integration, this update introduces other significant features:

**Browser Profiles**: Now broadly available to all users, allowing you to create and switch between different browsing setups (e.g., for work, personal use, or school).

**Visual Search**: A feature powered by Google Lens that is currently in testing for users who have Google set as their default search engine. It enables searching by right-clicking on images.
