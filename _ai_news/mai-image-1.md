Microsoft has introduced its first in-house text-to-image generation model, named MAI-Image-1. This model marks a significant step as Microsoft shifts more of its AI development internally, moving away from relying solely on partners like OpenAI for such technologies.

## Key features and development goals

The company trained this model with a focus on delivering value for creators, aiming to avoid "repetitive or generically-stylized outputs". The model is designed to excel at generating photorealistic imagery, including complex elements like lighting and landscapes, and is noted for its combination of speed and quality compared to larger, slower models.

## Current availability and performance

While MAI-Image-1 is not yet available in Copilot or Bing Image Creator, it has already made a notable debut. The model is currently ranked #9 on the AI benchmark leaderboard LMArena, where users test and vote on images generated by different AI systems. Microsoft has stated the model will be available in its consumer products "very soon".

## How to test MAI-Image-1 now

You can test the model immediately on the LMArena website:

- Navigate to the image generator page on LMArena.
- Change the mode from "Battle" to "Direct Chat" using the drop-down menu.
- Select mai-image-1 as the model.
- Type a description of the image you want to generate.
